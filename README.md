## openAI has a chat with claude illustrated by gemini

This is a Shiny app demonstrating two LLM models talk to each other. One is serious the other likes to joke. You can tweak the prompts. And the conversation is illustrated by gemini-2.0-flash-exp-image-generation model. You need API keys to access the LLMs. 

Have fun!
